<img src="/assets/images/apex_cover.png" width="200px" align="left" style="border:0px; margin:15px;"> When James Exosia is brought back from the brink of death by an angel, he discovers that he’s returned with a spark of divinity. Upon his introduction to angels and demons, James is shocked to learn that he’s now considered a “Hybrid” - a rare combination of human blood and angelic power.

But not everyone is thrilled about this development. The forces of Heaven and Hell - perpetually at war with each other - both want to make use of James’s unique skills. As James is unwillingly dragged into transcendental politics and supernatural warfare, he must balance his own goals and ambitions with the responsibilities and duties that come with his new power. For in the entire universe, there is nothing - save God Himself - that is more dangerous than a Hybrid.
