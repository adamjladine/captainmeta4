# Teaser

Private teaser area for upcoming chapters of Apex of Creation

Heaven was enormous - infinite, in fact - and yet the guide map managed to neatly convey its layout. The map even had a “you are here” marker that pegged me squarely in the lobby. There was a recreation level, featuring a pool, a workout gym, and fields for every organised sport ever developed by mankind - along with a few sports not developed by mankind. An activities wing was listed as including a library, spa, game room, music facilities, and more. And none of this was even part of Paradise, which was accessible via the Throne Room at the top level.

I would have to avoid that area, since reenacting the face-melting scene from *Raiders of the Lost Arc* wasn’t high on my list of priorities.
