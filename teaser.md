James knew angels. James also had superpowers. And he wanted to use them… for me. Why? He’d already busted my dad. So where is next semester’s tuition going to come from? Maybe an angel can hook me up with that? Am I sure that this all isn’t just a strange dream? No, I could definitely feel the effects of the self-refilling coffee.
