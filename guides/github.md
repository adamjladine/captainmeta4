# Using Github to Host Your Writing

Effective 06 June 2018, the Reddit user agreement will be claiming additional intellectual property rights over creative works posted to reddit. To avoid surrendering these rights to reddit, many authors want to find alternative hosts for their writing.

The Github user agreement allows you to retain your rights over creative works hosted on github. Github also hosts user sites, and is a good solution for hosting creative writing.

1. [Create a Github account](https://github.com/join) if you don't have one already.

2. [Create a new repository](https://github.com/new).

    * Name it `<username>.github.io`, where `<username>` is the same as your github username.
 
    * Under "Add a .gitignore" choose "Jekyll"

3. Open the repository settings
