Tool|Description
-|-
[Clear Unmoderated](./clear_unmod) | Approve all submissions in a subreddit's Unmoderated queue
[Comment Cleaner](./delete_comments) | Deletes all of your existing comments. Yes, *all* of them.

These reddit webtools work server-side until the requested task is complete. This means that you do not need to pre-load content, or re-trigger the tool every 1000 items.
