# Parking "Ticket"

*This is an actual exchange that I had with a private parking company. The conversation takes place from 11 August 2018 to 18 August 2018. Names have been redacted to protect the stupid.*

---

To whom it may concern:

On 11 August 2018, we found the attached “ticket” on our vehicle. As I’m sure you are aware, RedactedCorp is a private entity and does not have the authority to issue fines. I felt you should be aware that some asshole is attaching your company name and brand to fake tickets.

Hi Adam!

Sorry for any confusion here. We do have multiple signs posted on location, you must not have seen them. 

The tickets are invoices for vehicles that are found to be parking on private property without proper monetary consideration for the owner of that parking space.  We encourage you to be more careful when parking on private property in the future.  I also suggest paying this fine before the fee escalates. 

Thank you

B:

Thank you for your response. 

Proper monetary consideration was paid. I have a credit card transaction for $9 (two hours of time) less than two hours prior to the issuance of the ticket. 

But that is irrelevant. RedactedCorp is a private entity. Like all private entities, it lacks the legal authority to unilaterally impose fines of any nature. I would suggest closing out the ticket, as there is no obligation to pay it.

Hi Adam,

I think your tact here is rather interesting, not sure if it's the approach I would take!

I see now, your violation indicates you were cited for parking in two spots.  I'll take a look at the photos and let you know what I think.  

Thank you

B:

Let me be absolutely clear about something: the ticket is utterly worthless. It would have more value if used as toilet paper. It relies solely upon the recipient mistaking the ticket for a real ticket issued by law enforcement, and paying out of fear.

I call this bluff.

Tickets issued by law enforcement are real, must be either paid or contested in court, and have legal consequences if ignored.

Tickets issued by RedactedCorp are "real" in the sense that the paper exists. They do not need to be paid, do not need to be contested, do not even need to be responded to, and have no legal consequences for ignoring.

If your employer has led you to believe otherwise, then I can only express sympathy for you at their deception.

Okay I'll leave it open. Your plate information is in our system.

Thank you

My middle school principal will be thrilled to hear that his “permanent record” on me is no longer the most impotent and pointless thing in my life.

You have better things to do with your time then fight parking tickets. Have a nice weekend

---

Unlike your enforcement personnel. 

Take care.

I talked to the PEO, you should not have been issued a parking ticket.  You were over the line a little bit, but not enough to warrant a ticket.  You might consider a different strategy next time if fighting a ticket. Generally being nice and apologetic goes further with us.

B:

While I appreciate the gesture, I did not want to participate in RedactedCorp’s fantasy that its tickets carry even the slightest iota of meaning. Again, I can only express sympathy if your employer has led you to believe otherwise.

Just as your tickets make a mockery of actual law enforcement, I chose to make a mockery of your tickets.

As a side note, please make sure the bean counters don’t try to write off the ticket as a loss - RedactedCorp never had a valid claim to that money.

You obviously have taken the ticket seriously bc you're wasting everyone's time crafting these annoying emails.  Be careful parking in Redactedville!  You're in the list now

---

Which part of “your ticket would be more valuable if used as toilet paper” led you to think I was taking any of this seriously?

I’m having a blast, personally. It’s all a joke to me, just like the ticket.

I'm assuming you have more important things to do. Have a nice weekend
