# Parking "Ticket"

*Names have been redacted to protect the stupid.*

To whom it may concern:

On 11 August 2018, we found the attached “ticket” on our vehicle. As I’m sure you are aware, RedactedCorp is a private entity and does not have the authority to issue fines. I felt you should be aware that some asshole is attaching your company name and brand to fake tickets.

Hi Adam!

Sorry for any confusion here. We do have multiple signs posted on location, you must not have seen them. 

The tickets are invoices for vehicles that are found to be parking on private property without proper monetary consideration for the owner of that parking space.  We encourage you to be more careful when parking on private property in the future.  I also suggest paying this fine before the fee escalates. 

Thank you

B:

Thank you for your response. 

Proper monetary consideration was paid. I have a credit card transaction for $9 (two hours of time) less than two hours prior to the issuance of the ticket. 

But that is irrelevant. RedactedCorp is a private entity. Like all private entities, it lacks the legal authority to unilaterally impose fines of any nature. I would suggest closing out the ticket, as there is no obligation to pay it.
